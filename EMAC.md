# Basic description #
  * Note that there is no hurry in implementing this driver :)... Stuff like dynamic task loading is more important ATM!
  * Write basic steps to mixing C and assembler code; this is a byproduct, as this driver will be written in C
  * Provide basic interface to physical layer (EMAC\_Poll(...), EMAC\_Send(...)) through the EMAC
  * Ability to collect statistics
