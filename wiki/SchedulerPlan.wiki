= Weighted Round Robin =

  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_round_robin WRR description]
  * Process' weight is loaded from its TCB's T_PRIO
  * Process is chosen when it is next in TASKTAB and its T_FLAG is set to 0
  * If there are no ready processes, jump to __no_dis_task 
  * Loop in __no_dis_task, until interrupted
  * If process terminates before using all of its time slices, the rest are added to the next process' time
  * Q_LEFT contains the remaining time for current task  
  * At init  Q_LEFT = 0

= Priority Scheduler =

  * When priority scheduler is chosen, the processes are sorted using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubblesort Bubble sort]
  * When choosing a new process, always start at the beginning of TCBLIST
  * Choose the first process that has T_FLAG set to 0
  * The process executes until terminates or it releases the resources  (ex. SVC_SEND)
  * Q_LEFT is 0, it is never used
  * If there are no ready processes, jump to __no_dis_task 
  * Loop in __no_dis_task, until interrupted
