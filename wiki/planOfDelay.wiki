*DLYLIST* ... pointer to DELAY LIST


Structure of DELAY LIST:

_Example:_

First task that we want to insert:
 * D_TCB = 0x30
 * D_TOUT = 100 <- Number of jiffies

|| *P#1* ||
|| *0x30* ||
|| *100* ||

Second task that we want to insert:
 * D_TCB = 0x40
 * D_TOUT = 122 <- Number of jiffies

||P#1|| *P#2* ||
||0x30|| *0x40* ||
||100|| *22* ||

Third task that we want to insert:
 * D_TCB = 0x50
 * D_TOUT = 60 <- Number of jiffies

|| *P#3* ||P#1||P#2||
|| *0x50* ||0x30||0x40||
|| *60* ||40||22||
