#summary Plan for task terminal I/O implementation.

= Terminal I/O server =

Proposed concept:
  * A system task serves as terminal I/O server accepting requests via message passing and pushing them to serial console driver.

= I/O request descriptors =

Descriptors should contain the following information:
  * *RequestType* - type of IO request (read, write, ...)
  * *BufferPtr* - buffer pointer
  * *BufferLen* - length of buffer

Note that buffers have to be properly copied to and from application virtual memory space.

= Serial console driver =

Both current `printk` implementation and the new terminal I/O server should use this driver and not do stuff directly. After the driver is written `printk` should be ported to use it.
