This is LBOS-FRI general project repository of Little Bitty Operating System, developed by [Faculty of Computer and Information Science](http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/), [University of Ljubljana](http://www.uni-lj.si/en/), 3rd grade students.

  * Code is written for ARM (a RISC microprocessor) AT91SAM9260, using [WinIDEA](http://www.isystem.si/) (just for flashing and debugging, its editor sucks).

  * [General source code readme](http://code.google.com/p/lbos-fri/source/browse/trunk/README.txt) consisting of memory mapping, system call interface, macros, context switches, references, ...

  * [Minimal coding standard](http://code.google.com/p/lbos-fri/source/browse/trunk/CODING_STANDARD.txt) is what you need to follow

  * **Up to date** [TODO list](http://code.google.com/p/lbos-fri/wiki/TODO) is where you pick assignments (Note: LBOS.pdf or anything else from ucilnica.fri is completely **out of date**).

  * [Trunk source code](http://code.google.com/p/lbos-fri/source/browse/#svn/trunk) is what compiles and executes fine, prints a few messages, switches between tasks, switches LED, etc.

  * [Branches source](http://code.google.com/p/lbos-fri/source/browse/#svn/branches) is where groups test their code before having it merged into trunk.

  * [OS development howtos](http://www.osdev.org/)
